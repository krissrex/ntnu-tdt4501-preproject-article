\section{Tree Editor}\label{sec:result-tree-editor}

This section will present the findings for a \emph{Tree Editor}.

\subsection{Functional requirements for final editor}

Here is a list of identified requirements, in \cref{tab:function-requirements}.
Note that it may not be complete, with regards to usability and all possible features for \gls{mdd} tools.
More requirements should be specified for a final product, in further works.
A good source for requirements are the existing editors mentioned in \cref{sec:ecore-editors}, with regards to a complete solution with good usability.

\subsection{Architecture and protocols}

A suggestion for an architecture is to use an \emph{VSCode extension} with a \emph{WebView} and \emph{CustomEditor}.
Connect the extension to a bundled \emph{Tree Language Server} by using \gls{JSON-RPC} or \gls{REST} and \gls{WebSocket}.
The transport mechanism between the extension and the Tree Language Server can be either standard input/output (stdio) or TCP sockets.
The Tree Language Server should hold any language dependent details, like mappings from \gls{Ecore} over to a generic tree structure.
Any changes to the model should be relayed from the extension via the Tree Language Server to the Model Server.
The extension should only talk about changes in a general manner with the Tree Language Server.
These will be converted to \gls{Ecore} specific operations in the Tree Language Server before being sent to the Model Server over a \gls{REST} \acrshort{API}.
A diagram with this architecture is shown in \cref{fig:tree-editor-architecture}.

\paragraph*{Sharing a Model Server}
Because multiple extensions might require the same Model Server, an idea (not explored yet) is to have a specific VSCode Extension only for providing this Model Server.
Other extensions can then notify a dependence on this extension, causing it to be installed.
This seems supported at least in VSCode.
The Model Server extension would then provide the details for connecting to it, to other extensions.
It is possible to discover other extensions and get an \gls{API} from them.
