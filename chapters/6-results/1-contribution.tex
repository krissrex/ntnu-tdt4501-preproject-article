\section{Contribution}

This thesis will provide an overview of the developments in \gls{cloud} \glspl{IDE} with regards to modeling in \gls{emf}.
An analysis of the data will show how existing tools and architectures can be applied in a new \gls{cloud} \gls{IDE} for \gls{Ecore} modeling.

Additionally, a foundation for a \emph{software product} will be presented.
The foundations will be built further upon in a master's thesis.
The foundations are a set of software requirements and an initial architecture for a \gls{cloud} based \gls{Ecore} Tree editor inside an existing \gls{cloud} \gls{IDE}.
