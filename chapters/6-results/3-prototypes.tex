\section{Prototypes}

Prototypes are used to answer some of the research sub-questions.
First, one or more questions are selected for a prototype.
Then a design document is created, which details goals and architecture of the prototype.
Next, the implementation is done.
Finally, the implementation is executed and evaluated.


This thesis has a total of two prototypes.
The first, \emph{prototype 1}, aims to answer \cref{rq:22}.
The second, \emph{prototype 2}, aims to answer \cref{rq:23}, \cref{rq:24}, \cref{rq:25} and \cref{rq:26}.
