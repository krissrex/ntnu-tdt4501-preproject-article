\subsection{Integrated Development Environments}

A short list of relevant \glspl{IDE} is \gls{Eclipse}, \gls{VSCode} and \gls{Theia}.
\Gls{Eclipse} is where modeling has happened traditionally.
\Gls{VSCode} is focused on editing text, and not a contender in the \gls{mdd} space. However, it is extremely popular.~\cite{stackoverflowStackOverflowDeveloper2019}
\Gls{Theia} is an new editor based on \gls{VSCode} but adapted for the \gls{cloud}.
