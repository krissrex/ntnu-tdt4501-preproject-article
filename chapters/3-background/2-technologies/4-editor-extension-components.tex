\subsection{Editor Extension Components}

This section will describe the most relevant components, libraries or widgets for \acrshort{emf} in the \gls{cloud}, which can be used to create editor extensions.


\subsubsection{Sprotty}
Eclipse Sprotty is a library to render diagrams in web browsers.
It uses Typescript, CSS and svg.
Sprotty can animate diagram changes.
The architecture is made with \gls{LSP} in mind, and supports having diagram data sent from a backend.
The library is configurable using dependency injection, and allows for adding custom nodes, edges and behaviors.
It also provides ``glue code'' for easy integration with \gls{LSP}, \gls{Theia} and \gls{ELK}.~\cite{smithEclipseSprotty2018}
An example of a sprotty diagram is shown in \cref{fig:sprotty-example}.

The library is mainly developed by TypeFox and EclipseSource, and managed by the Eclipse Foundation.~\cite{eclipsefoundationEclipseSprotty}
