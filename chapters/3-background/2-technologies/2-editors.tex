\subsection{Editors}\label{sec:editors}

This section will describe the most relevant \acrfullpl{IDE} for \acrlong{emf} and the \gls{cloud}.

\subsubsection{Visual Studio Code}\label{sec:vscode}

\paragraph*{What it is}
Visual Studio Code (\gls{VSCode}) is a text editor and \acrfull{IDE} created by
Microsoft. The VSCode editor is based on the \gls{open source}\footnote{Source for VSCode is available at \href{https://github.com/microsoft/vscode}{https://github.com/microsoft/vscode}} software (OSS) called \emph{VS Code Project}.~\cite{helmingEclipseTheiaIDE2019} 
The VSCode editor has Microsoft-specific customizations, which makes it slightly different from the OSS project.~\cite{microsoftMicrosoftVscode2020} (This is analogous to the relationship between the \gls{open source} Chromium and the proprietary Google Chrome.)

\end{figure}

\paragraph*{Intended use} Primarily an editor for textual programming languages.
VSCode has no support for diagrams or binary file viewers (like 3D models) out of the box. By default, it supports \texttt{Javascript}, \texttt{Typescript} and \texttt{Markdown}; common technologies related to web development.
VSCode can be extended to support other languages and editors, see \cref{chap:vscode-extension}.

% What does it do?
% Who made it?
% Architecture

\paragraph*{Architecture}
VSCode runs as a desktop application, and uses Electron and javascript for its runtime.
The architecture is centered on a \emph{core} which loads \emph{extensions}.
The core is shown in \cref{fig:vscode-layers-architecture}, and is split internally into \emph{layers} with different responsibilies.
Each layer is again organized based on the target runtime, like \emph{browser} or \emph{\gls{Electron}}, as seen in \cref{fig:vscode-component-architecture}.
The actual text editor in \gls{VSCode} is called \emph{Monaco}, and is available as a standalone package.~\cite{benjaminpaseroSourceCodeOrganization2020}

Every layer is organized by runtime dependencies.~\cite{benjaminpaseroSourceCodeOrganization2020}}\label{fig:vscode-component-architecture}

\subsubsection{Theia}\label{sec:theia}

\paragraph*{What it is}
\Gls{Theia} is an editor like \gls{VSCode}, but designed from the start to work in web browsers.
The project was originally started by TypeFox, and then donated to the Eclipse Foundation.
It is free and fully \gls{open source}\footnote{Source for Theia is available at \href{https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/}{https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/}}.
\Gls{Theia} is based on some of the same components as \gls{VSCode}, and uses Monaco as well.
The main uses of Theia now is as an editor for workspace software like \gls{Che} and \gls{Gitpod}.

\paragraph*{Intended use}
\Gls{Theia} was created to be a framework for creating custom and
white-labeled \acrshortpl{IDE} and tools. Theia itself was not an IDE.~\cite{helmingEclipseTheiaIDE2019}

\paragraph*{Architecture --- runtime}
The architecture of Theia is similar to \gls{VSCode}.
The biggest difference is in the runtime.
\Gls{Theia} is split into a backend and frontend process. 
The backend can run remotely. 
The frontend is \gls{Electron} or a browser.
The backend and frontend communicate with \gls{JSON-RPC} over \glspl{WebSocket} or \gls{REST}/HTTP.
Both the frontend and backend source codes are heavily architected around
\emph{dependency injection}.
The backend runs an \texttt{ExpressJs} web server which serves code to the frontend (see \cref{fig:theia-communication}).~\cite{typefoxArchitectureOverview}

The frontend can always assume it has \texttt{browser API}, but not
\texttt{NodeJS}/\texttt{Electron} \gls{API}.~\cite{typefoxArchitectureOverview}

To support different programming languages, the backend talks over the \acrfull{LSP} with different \emph{language servers}.
One backend process serves one workspace/user.
Multiple clients can connect, but they will all share the same workspace.~\cite{MultiLanguageIDEImplemented2017}
