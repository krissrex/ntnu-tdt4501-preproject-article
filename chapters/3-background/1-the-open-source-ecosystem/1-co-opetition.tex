\subsection{Co-opetition}

% core emf platform but competing tools

% Obeo+SiriusWeb+ObeoDesigner competes with EclipseSource+EMF.Cloud+GLSP
% Theia competes with VSCode
% Che competes with Gitpod

\paragraph*{Starting of with a digression}

An interesting consequence of companies pushing for open standards while providing their own services and tools, is this mix of co-operation and competition: \emph{co-opetition}.

Obeo works to make Sirius great, while providing their proprietary Obeo Designer.
At the same time, EclipseSource is competing with its GLSP and their own consulting services.
But both of these want to push \gls{emf} and \gls{Ecore} forward, by cooperating on its tools and underlying technologies, because these are used at the core of their own products.

Another instance is Typefox with Gitpod, competing with RedHat's Che.
However, both contribute to the \gls{IDE} they use: \gls{Theia}.
