\section{Overview}

% Broad overview of the ecosystem,
% before diving into detail

An overview of the background material is shown in \cref{fig:background-overview}, before diving into it.
The figure is not optimal with respect to readability, but it illustrates that many of the items are related.
Not all relations are shown either, to maintain \emph{some level} of readbility.
