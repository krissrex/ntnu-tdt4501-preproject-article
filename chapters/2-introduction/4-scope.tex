\section{Scope}

% How the preproject is limited
This thesis is limited in scope, because it is part of a specialization project.
The main purpose of the thesis is to research and explore the background material. 
This thesis will be followed up by a master's thesis.
Therefore, this thesis will only solve a part of the problems found.

The research questions in \cref{chap:research-questions} will be refined from this exploration.
Some software development will be done, but the goal will be determining feasibility and discovering potential problems for a final solution.
The development will mainly be exploratory prototyping.
