\section{Stakeholders}

\paragraph*{Kristian Rekstad (author)} I believe \acrfull{mdd} has potential, but is being held back by the tools. As a soon-to-be professional developer, I hope that I can leverage the best parts of \acrshort{mdd} in my professional career.
I will be doing the development of any discovered solution, at least initially.
If the solution is ``good'', it may be handed over to an \gls{open source} community for further development and maintenance.

\paragraph*{Hallvard Tr√¶tteberg} This project's supervisor and associate professor at the Department of Computer Science at \acrshort{NTNU}. 
He has lectured \textit{TDT4250: Advanced Software Design} and uses \acrshort{emf} there.
He has an expert level understanding of \gls{Eclipse}'s internal architecture and design.
A solution that can increase students' interest in learning \acrshort{mdd} would be of interest. 
He also seeks to move lecturing over from \gls{Eclipse} to the \gls{cloud} and \gls{Theia}-based \gls{Gitpod}, if this is possible.

\paragraph*{Norwegian University of Science and Technology (\acrshort{NTNU})} They educate students in \acrlong{mdd}, and currently use \acrshort{emf}. Their lectures could use a cloud based modeling editor instead of \gls{Eclipse}.

\paragraph*{Eclipse Foundation} They own and maintain the \acrlong{emf}, as well as \gls{Theia} and \gls{Eclipse}.
