\chapter*{Abstract}

\Acrlong{mdd} is a an approach to software engineering.
A common framework for \gls{mdd} is the \acrlong{emf}.
However, students resist learning it because of its use of unpopular technologies.
This thesis comes before a master's thesis, and looks at how modeling can be moved to cloud based editors in order to renew the technology stack.
At the same time, opportunities for saving effort are found, by reusing existing implementations, architectures and protocols from other tools.
This thesis ends by finding the need for a tree based editor, and testing the feasibility of it.
Finally, some requirements and an architecture for such an editor are found.
These can be further studied and implemented in a master's thesis.
