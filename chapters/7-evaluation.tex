\chapter{Evaluation}

% Sketch out.
% With regards to software requirements

\emph{Because this is a specialization project before a masters thesis, the emphasis has not been on evaluation. Only a brief evaluation follows.}


\par
The research questions were answered by the prototypes.
Not all questions were answered properly, due to time constraints.
This is \cref{rq:23} and \cref{rq:26}.

\par
The main research question, \cref{rq:21} got a partial answer.
The list of requirements is not complete, and only lists the most relevant requirements for a \gls{cloud} based architecture.
More is likely needed to get a highly usable product.
