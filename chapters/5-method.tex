\paragraph*{How to answer the research questions}
To solve the sub-research questions \cref{rq:22} to \cref{rq:26}, a design and creation approach will be used.
Developing prototypes and testing them in the real environment can quickly remove doubts about feasibility, as long as the prototype works.
(In case a prototype fails to demonstrate a working approach, a new approach will have to be designed and tested in a new prototype.
If no new design can be made, then the background material needs further research.)

\paragraph*{Software requirements for a solution}

% What is a good solution
%  - How it fits into an existing ecosystem

% TODO: write

% Software requirements for the results

% Solve RQ2.1 with prototype 1
% Solve RQ2.2 with model server
% Solve RQ2.3 with prototype 2
% Solve RQ2.4 with prototype 2
% Solve RQ2.5 with prototype 2 [WIP]

% Answer RQ2 with diagrams from design-doc of prototype 2?
