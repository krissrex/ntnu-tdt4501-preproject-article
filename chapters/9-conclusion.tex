\chapter{Conclusion}

% Sketch out.

\emph{Because this is a specialization project before a masters thesis, the emphasis has not been on providing a thorough conclusion. Only a brief conclusion follows.}

\par
The tools from \gls{emf} can be moved to the \gls{cloud}.
Editors of \gls{Ecore} can be re-implemented to \gls{cloud} \acrshortpl{IDE} by using extension mechanisms.
Existing tooling for model validation, parsing and generation can be embedded inside those extensions.
This removes the need for re-implementing the entire framework, and therefore saves effort.

\par
The need for a Tree Editor was found.
Initial prototypes show that it is possible to create.
Requirements and an architecture for such a Tree Editor is proposed, drawing inspiration from earlier protocols like \gls{LSP} and \gls{GLSP}.
Further work is needed to establish the protocol for this Tree Editor, and all the software requirements.
Further work is then needed to implement this software solution.

\par
The practice of having a generic client and specific server seems applicable to more editors than just text based editors.
This architecture could be the basis of many migrations from editors in desktop \acrshortpl{IDE} to \gls{cloud} based \acrshortpl{IDE}.
