## Abstract

> Model-Driven Development is a an approach to software engineering. A common
framework for Model-Driven Development (MDD) is the Eclipse Modeling Framework. However, students resist learning it because of its use of unpopular technologies. This thesis comes before a master’s thesis, and looks at how modeling
can be moved to cloud based editors in order to renew the technology stack. At
the same time, opportunities for saving effort are found, by reusing existing implementations, architectures and protocols from other tools. This thesis ends by
finding the need for a tree based editor, and testing the feasibility of it. Finally,
some requirements and an architecture for such an editor are found. These can
be further studied and implemented in a master’s thesis.

### Building document locally

The repo provides a simple `Makefile` which allows you to build the document locally. This requires that you have a LaTeX compiler, such as [`texlive`](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), installed locally, which has to provide the commands `pdflatex` and `biber`.
