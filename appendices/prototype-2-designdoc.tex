\chapter{Prototype 2 --- Design Document}\label{app:prototype-2-design-doc}

This is the design document used before implementing prototype 2.
The prototype refers to itself as \emph{ecore-tree-editor}.
It refers to the bundled \texttt{.jar} file as \emph{EMF.Cloud Model Server}.
The design document refers to a \emph{Tree Language Server}, which is not implemented.
To keep the project simple while at an early stage, the Model Server is interacted with directly in the ecore-tree-editor, bypassing the need for a Tree Language Server.
This Tree Language Server would evetually be added as a \texttt{.jar} file, to use the already provided Model Server java client interfaces.
